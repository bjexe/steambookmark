### Usage
- Make an account at http://www.steambookmark.vercel.app 
- Track accounts by inserting a link to a steam profile or a steam account's ID in the input field and submit
- Click the refresh accounts button to refresh the ban status on all tracked accounts (this is done manually to ensure the steam API key is not rate limited)
- If any new bans are detected, a window will pop up notifying you of which accounts have received a game or VAC ban
